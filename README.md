## **Motivation**

The database chosen will contain data about US congressional members, and supplemental data about each member. Because there are two chambers of congress, we will include members from both chambers, House of Representatives and Senate. For each member in each chamber, we will incorporate attributes such as their political party, state, district, associated committees, and possibly demographic information. Additionally, we plan to include the most recent **â‰ˆ**5 congressional sessions accounting for the past 20 years.

We chose this topic because we were aware that there would be a lot of data that could be retrieved to make the database possible. Because of this, it became easier for us to brainstorm potential tables to be incorporated. With the current state of our government, we thought that this would be a good resource for citizens to gather information about a congressman or search for their contact information.

## **Target Audience**

This database would be a resource regarding current and past representatives in the U.S. Congress and it could be useful for any citizen wanting to find out more about the legislative branch of government and who were his/her state representatives in each chamber. It would also be useful in finding out how to contact any representative about the concerning issue. 

## **Sample Data**

Our plan for obtaining data is to use data that is already provided through many different links. Since our project touches on the topic of the U.S government specifically, the spectrum of the U.S congress, there's a lot of available data that can be used for our database. This link, [https://www.house.gov/](https://www.house.gov/), has all the data needed about the House of Representatives, including data such as their names, phone numbers, political affiliation, state, committees, etc. Another source we plan to use to collect data for our database will come from this link, [https://www.senate.gov/index.htm](https://www.senate.gov/index.htm). This link provides data about the Senate that includes, names, states, etc. Our database will also include data about the US Chambers of Commerce CCC100 and this url provides all the data that our group will use for our database, [https://www.uschamber.com/chamber-of-commerce-committee-of-100](https://www.uschamber.com/chamber-of-commerce-committee-of-100). Data on the Lobbyists will come from this link, [http://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/top-lobbyists](http://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/top-lobbyists); we also plan to collect data from [https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/members/](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/members/) as well.
