##  **Team Philosophy and Ground Rules**

Working on projects is a collective endeavor and opportunity for exchange of ideas; creativity and initiative are important facets of successful teamwork. Notwithstanding, under no circumstances a member should be put in a position of feeling threatened or pressured by another. Being tolerant and open minded are core values that this team will adhere to. All thoughts and contributions are welcomed including constructive criticism,  as long as it is done in a polite and respectful manner. It is also imperative that any inquiries or concerns between team members are addressed in a timely manner and with mutual regard. 


As members of the team, our individual contributions are a measure of collective success, thus our willingness to put an effort, our enthusiasm and positive attitude toward common goal can bring sense of accomplishment and pride on multiple levels and to all fellow collaborators within the team.


##  **Team Meetings**

The team will schedule meetings through the app GroupMe in the designated chat group that has been created for the team. In-person team meetings can be scheduled after 12PM noon on T/Th or alternative time convenient to all members. In the event when a member is not able to participate in a scheduled meetup, it can be either rescheduled for another time or the meeting can happen without him/her being present and the appropriate update will be communicated afterwards. The team will meet either online (Skype, Discord, FaceTime, etc.), depending on what the group has agreed upon. 




##  **Team Debate and Conflict**


When making decisions, the team must agree before moving forward with said decision. In the event a member disagrees with a decision he/she will be able to explain the underlying reasoning and propose the alternative options. In this case the team will vote on these decisions and the final decision will be made by the majority rule.




#### Task Delegation

The team will collectively agree on delegating particular tasks to each member throughout steps of the Project. These tasks will be assigned through in-person meetings, online meetings, or through GroupMe. Every member will turn in their work a week before project deadlines (this can be changed if the team agrees on it). This approach will allow the team for a thorough collective feedback and revision of any possible errors before submittals. In the event of a team member not being able to fulfill his/her assigned work obligations, other team members will need to pick up the slack and complete the work. In case of such occurrence, the lack of cooperation will be noted and if determined as inexcusable, it may likely be communicated with the lead professor; this in turn may affect the grade of the delinquent individual's for his contribution to the project.


#### 	Provisions for Dealing with Problem Team Members

If a team member exhibits any of the above mentioned behaviors, the remaining members of the team will confer on seriousness of the conduct and most fitting consequences; depending on the particulars of the situation, they may or may not find it excusable. In any event, at least a tactful verbal/written notice will be given, if not a stern warning. This can be done through GroupMe or email.
